Assignment: 
Merge Two Sorted Singly Linked Lists
Objective: The objective of this assignment is to write a C program that merges two sorted singly linked lists into a single sorted linked list.
Requirements:
Implement the program in the C programming language.
The program should define a structure for a singly linked list node, including the data and a pointer to the next node.
Write a function to create a new node with the given data.
Write a function to insert a node at the end of a linked list.
Write a function that merges two sorted linked lists into a single sorted list. The function should take two linked lists as input and return the merged list.
The program should provide a function to display the elements of a linked list.
Test the program with the following data and expected output:
Two sorted singly linked lists:
List 1: 1 3 5 7
List 2: 2 4 6
After merging the two sorted lists, the output should be:
Merged List: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Submission: 
Submit the C program file (.c) that implements the requirements mentioned above on GitHub.
Make sure to test the program with various inputs and verify that it produces the expected output.
Good luck with your assignment!
